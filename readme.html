<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
As with any project it is best to have a structure by which you approach it. For certain project such a structure is in your head, for other project you need a cheat sheet. Website layouts are such a project for me. Primarily I work on software that is used for modelling scenario's, on the side I like to work on web applications and a dealing with CSS is always a part of that. I'm not a designer, so my goal is to make things look good with minimum effort leaving more time available for the stuff that I personally enjoy better.
</p> 
<p>
A while ago I stumbled into the <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery library</a>, what a tresure that is. It has all sorts of goodies that make your application look so much better. Personally, I'm a big fan of the sortable methods, but obviously jQuery has much more it offers the world. Together with great functionality jQuery has an integrated theme roller.  
</p>
<p>
The theme roller is the focus at this point. Basically, it works with all the functionalities that are offered in an integrated way. So when you work on a project and want to change the layout of the web application pluggin in a new theme gets the job done. Now, since the theme roller provides a lot, but not everything there will be the need to add a couple of things manually. The goal is to set it up in such a way that the custom attributes can we adjusted in a simple way when the theme is changed.
</p>
<p>
To achieve the above the idea is to make the custom attributes dependent on the images and color scheme that comes with the theme. The attributes that I'm interested in are a header navigation bar, a footer and several content frames. The contraint that I will work under is that the custom style sheet should contain a reference to each color and image only once.   
</p>
<h1>Basic structure - footer and non-footer - header and container</h1>
<p>
Starting with the footer brings us to the first important decision in our structure. As can be read in this article on <a href="http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/using-sticky-footer-code.html">sticky footers</a> it can be problematic to get the footer to stick at the bottom of the page in case the content of the page is less than 100% of the page. I believe there is a spectrum of solutions to this, but this particular solution seems the be effective an simple, which makes it perfect in this context.  
</p>
<p>
The solution to the sticky footer dictates that the page is cut up vertically in a <b>non-footer</b> and a <b>footer</b> part. The second vertical devision is the header and the container. Within the header and container of the non-footer and in the footer a horizontal devision can be defined. This is done by a .center class.  
</p>
<h1>Frames</h1>
<p>In the past I used to combine style object and positioning objects. For example to wrap content in a box with a header, boundary, rounded corners, certain dimentions and a certain position, I would create an css-id or css-class with all these properties. My new approach is to separate dimentions and positioning from other style properties. This means that there will be more div statements in the html code, which is the price to pay for fewer css-id and css-class definitions. In order to integrate jQuery tools with the custom items this separation is desirable anyway.</p>    
<p>
As defined in the css box model the actual width of an element is determined by the sum of the borders, margins, paddings and the specified width. Since the frame classes we define are only there to define dimensions and position it is most convenient to set the borders, margins and paddings to zero. These properties will be defined by the elements within the different frames. 
</p>
<p>
To start simple frames with three different widths are defined combined with floating properties left and right. This simple setup is defined in the stylesheet that can be found in the repository together with a demo.
